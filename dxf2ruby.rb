# About DXF (Nots from AutoCAD)
#
# DXF _Objects_ have no graphical representation. (aka nongraphical objects)
# DXF _Entities_ are graphical objects.

# Accommodating DXF files from future releases of AutoCAD® will be easier
# if you write your DXF processing program in a table-driven way, ignore
# undefined group codes, and make no assumptions about the order of group codes
# in an entity. With each new AutoCAD release, new group codes will be added to
# entities to accommodate additional features.
